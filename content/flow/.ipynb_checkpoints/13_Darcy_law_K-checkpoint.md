# Basic Hydrogeology

## Definition

Hydrogeology (hydro- meaning water, and -geology meaning the study of the Earth) is the area of geology that deals with the distribution and movement of groundwater in the soil and rocks of the Earth's crust (commonly in aquifers). The terms groundwater hydrology, geohydrology, and hydrogeology are often used interchangeably.

## Components of hydrogeology

The Darcy's Law:

$$
Q = K I A
$$

with $q$ [L<sup>3</sup>T<sup>-1</sup>] is discharge through a media with conductivity $K$ [LT<sup>-1</sup>], passing through the surface $A$ [L<sup>2</sup>] with a head gradient $I$ [-], which is given as $I = \frac{h_{in}-h_{out}}{L}$. $h_{in}$ and $h_{out}$ [L] represents hydraulic heads at the inlet and outlet respectively, and $L$ is the length of the length [L] of the column.
